## Conventions in these docs

- **Shipped** means the code in the current `1.0.16` tree does it.
- **Reference** numbers are measured on the stated machine and corpus. They are
  not guarantees; see [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) for the caveats.
- **Not shipped** is called out explicitly. Visual search, native OCR, and
  bundled LLM/chat are not in the production path.

Planning documents and internal experiment logs were removed for the 1.0.16
documentation pass; the shipped behavior lives in the pages above.
